# Mipper

Mipper was a multipurpose Discord bot with multiple functions:

* Moderation commands
* Utility commands
* Geometry Dash level and profile browsing
* AI chatbot
* Online dashboard

Just to name a few.

Believe it or not, but Mipper was the first project that actually made me start programming in early 2022. I kept refining and polishing it, ensuring that it's a well-made bot.

But nothing lasts forever. On September 15th, 2024, Mipper was officially shut down. The reason is because I couldn't afford paying for YandexGPT's API and the VPS much longer. Moreover, I lost motivation to keep maintaining it, combined with me entering high school.

So in order to honor Mipper's legacy, I'm publicly uploading the source code. It may be messy, unstable and buggy, **but it's mine**.

Rest in Peace, Mipper. 2022/01/10 - 2024/09/15
